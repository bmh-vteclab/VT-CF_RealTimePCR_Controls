# VT-CF_RealTimePCR_Controls
Databases for control sequences to be used with the VT real-time PCR and the CF real-time PCR developed at Health Canada - Bureau of Microbial Hazards and Canadian Food Inspection Agency â€“ Ottawa Carling Laboratory. Control sequences consist of gene fragments of verotoxin (Shiga toxin) genes and genes involved in host colonisation (eae, aggR, aaiC) that comprise the sequence between the forward and reverse primers.

NCBI accession numbers and other information used to generate the databases of gene fragments are in: AccessionNumbers_and_info.txt

Control sequences to be used for QC of the primer and probe pools for VT real-time PCR are in: vt_realtimePCR_QCcontrols.txt

Control sequences to be used for QC of the primer and probe pools for CF real-time PCR are in: cf_realtimePCR_QCcontrols.txt

A positive control sequence that can be used with both VT real-time PCR and CF real-time PCR is in: vt-cf_realtimePCR_control.txt
